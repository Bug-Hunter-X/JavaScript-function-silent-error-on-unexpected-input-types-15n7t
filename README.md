# JavaScript Silent Error Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function that silently fails when given unexpected input types. The function `foo` is intended to return the length of an array or string, or 0 if the input is `null` or `undefined`. However, it does not handle other object types correctly, resulting in a silent error.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function uses `x.length` to get the length of the input. If `x` is not an array or string, `x.length` is `undefined` instead of throwing an error.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in the program, without any clear indication of what went wrong.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves adding explicit checks to handle non-array/string objects and return 0 in those cases.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and run it using a JavaScript environment (e.g. Node.js).
3. Observe the unexpected output when the function receives an object as input.
